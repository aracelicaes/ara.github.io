This is page was built to display the different projects developed during my CIT 230 Class at BYU-I. You will find:
*The Website Planning Document

*The final Weather Page
*Temple-Inn Suites: a site built and designed from scratch. 

## Features:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# The Weather Page
<div align= "left"><img src="images/weatherpage.png"></div>

## Built With
* HTML
* Vanilla CSS
* Javascript
* API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

## About this Project
The requirements of this project were to build the design and our content of the Site using HTML and CSS. Javascript was used to integrate the API from OpenWeatherMap. It was also used to facilitate other features such as the hamburguer menu on the small/mobile view of the page.<br>
CSS Grids, Flexbox were used for the display.
